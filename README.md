# Delegate in use
A delegate is an object that holds the method(s) reference or is a method(s) pointer.

Since delegate knows how to call a method we can use it to define callback methods and implement event handling. Delegates are type-safe, secure, and object-oriented.

## There are 4 types of delegates in .NET
1. Delegate (basic form)
2. Action
3. Func
4. Predicate
